# JSCore - Minecraft-aware JS Runtime

**Guides (TODO)** | [**Yarnwrap**](https://github.com/FabricCore/yarnwrap)

JSCore provides JavaScript support to Minecraft, putting no restrictions on what can be done.

**Wraps** provide access to obfuscated Java classes from the base game. Classes provided by mods are typically not obfuscated and can be accessed directly.
- [**Yarnwrap**](https://github.com/FabricCore/yarnwrap) - provide access to most Minecraft classes.
- **Mixinwrap** (TODO) - provide very limited access to Minecraft mixins.
